# Cell state velocities

This Github repository is complementary to our paper **"Towards reliable quantification of cell state velocities"**, which is out as preprint on Biorxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.17.484754v1). In this repository you can find all the Python scripts and notebooks that you will need to reproduce the figures in the paper.

This repository is still under construction, so **stay tuned** for more features and insights into our method.

Any questions or comments? Feel free to write us under issues (https://github.com/bjbouman/cell-state-velocities/issues)
